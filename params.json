Since the original code is completely closed, I'm flying blind on a large majority of internal processes and properties. Therefore, some will be modified or outright replaced in some fashion.\r\n\r\n###When will it be done?###\r\nWhen it's done!\r\n\r\nHonestly, there's no estimated timeline because of how large an undertaking this is.\r\n\r\n###Are you crazy?###\r\nMore than certainly!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
