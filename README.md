DFXNA
======

A sincere thanks to Tarn and Zach Adams for creating this wonderful, complex, and overall jaw-dropping 
piece of work.

This aims to be an open source (albeit inferior) clone of the ever-popular game "Dwarf Fortress", 
written in C# with XNA 4.

All code is mine - ideas, content, and general motivation are all the property of Bay 12 Games.
